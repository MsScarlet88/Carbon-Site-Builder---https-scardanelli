# About 

Lo-Lo is low salt and low sugar
(and only a little fat!). Each week I share
one of my favourite recipes, helping you
take control of your own health.

-----------


Lo-Lo cooking uses principles that are natural, environmentally respectful,
and sustainable, in order to create wonderful meals. Expect simple, healthy
vegetarian food, with the occasional guest cook for sh. We’ll also have
some nice but naughty sweet treats, of course!
I’m not here to prescribe what you should do, but just to share what
helps me feel good, retain health, and live in tune with nature. I’ve
collected and developed many favourite recipes over the years and
also share heritage recipes, which deserve to be re-discovered.
We’ll use simple and seasonal ingredients (I grow much of my own
veg), using basic tools and techniques, whilst having fun and always
keeping it interesting with herbs & spices. You know yourself better
than anyone else. A little is more than nothing and if you would
like to learn some vegetarian and shy recipes,
I’ll show you the Lo-Lo way to go.....
