# About 

Lo-Lo is low salt and low sugar
(and only a little fat!). Each week I share
one of my favourite recipes, helping you
take control of your own health.

I am an artist, enthusiastic film maker, conscientious and versatile Designer with a ‘hands on’ approach and a ‘can do’ attitude. I make and produce things physically and digitally. I have experience across many business sectors, and am always keen to embrace new ideas, technology and to gain new skills. I am confident in taking client briefs, creating and developing concepts, managing my time effectively and liaising with clients and suppliers to ensure quality work is delivered according to brief and schedule. I care about the environment and recycling, reducing waste in general and love to share my ideas and enthusiasm with other professionals, to create great work of which I can be proud. I also meditate regularly and swim.
